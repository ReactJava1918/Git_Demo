Use git pull when you want to quickly update your local branch with changes from the remote, and you are not concerned about having a linear history.
Use git fetch to inspect changes before deciding to merge or rebase. It allows you to update remote tracking branches without immediately merging.
Use git merge for a straightforward combination of changes, resulting in a new commit capturing the merged state.
Use git rebase for creating a clean, linear history by transplanting your changes onto a new base commit.
